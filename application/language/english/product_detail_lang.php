$lang['pro4_title']='Connected double dragger';
$lang['pro4_derection']="
<p>Introduction:</p> 
<p>This equipment is a key equipment for extruder to produce aluminum and aluminum alloy profiles. Mainly used for dragging, saw cutting separation, conveying extrusion molding aluminum, bar material.</p>
<p> When working, the clamps of the dragging car bite the front end of the profile, well maintains certain tension with the profile, and automatically synchronizes with the extrusion speed of the extruder, the profile is drawn out flat and straight from the mold cavity, so as to avoid uneven lengths of the extruded profiles and prevent the profile from hanging elastic distortion, so as to improve the finished profile rate and surface quality of the profile. </p>
<p>Drawn profile with a certain tension, to make the material can be cooled under tension and reduce deformation, so that the metal flow is even when multiple bars are extruded, and helps speed up the part where the metal flow is slow at the mold fixed-diameter band when a single bar is extruded, which to make the metal flows uniformly across the whole section, which roughly compensates for 5% of the outflow.</p>
<p> The production efficiency can be improved by adopting the double dragger. The double dragging system does not need to rely on the non-extrusion cycle to rearrange the expected next extrusion cycle, and it can achieve the purpose of continuous extrusion without stopping cutting. As a system, double dragger provides higher output while reducing waste.</p>
